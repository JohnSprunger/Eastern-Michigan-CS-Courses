 Program Description:
 Pick cards from a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly and
 find out how many picks are needed before you can see one of each
 suit. Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck before
 picking another. Write a Java program that simulates the number
 of picks needed to get four cards(one from each suit) and display
 the four cards picked.
